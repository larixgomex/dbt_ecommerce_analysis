# ⭐️ E-commerce dbt models
 
This project focused on setting dbt models for the purchasing team in an e-commerce sportswear store.
The goal is to monitor stock to avoid stock-outs and to order the right products at the right time.

The different steps of this project are:

**1 - Data exploration and cleaning**  
Understanding the structure of the tables, defining the primary keys, and cleaning the data.

**2 - Data Enrichment**  
Adding new columns: descriptive dimensions/categories and KPI/metrics.

**3 - Data Aggregation**  
Performing aggregations that will allow the team to analyze inventory.
